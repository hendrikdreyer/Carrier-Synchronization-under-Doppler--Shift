Carrier Synchronization under Doppler shift for Mobile Communication

My 1995 final year mini-thesis regarding carrier synchronization under Doppler shift.

Abstract
The past few years the need increased for effective high speed data communication over mobile band limits. The effiectiveness
of data communication is influenced through phenomena such as Doppler shift. Therefore, the need surfaced for better carrier 
recovery as well as the detection and estimation of Doppler offsets. 
The problem was approached by means of software simulaiton. Different systems were simulated under different conditions. 
The results that were achieved indicated that the frequency difference detector technique (quadri-correlator), that was implemented, 
gratified itself and that it could be realised in hardware. Another technique called the inverse bandpass filter that was developed 
by the author showed remarkable results and thus, more research into this technique should be done. Both the last two techniques are 
comparable with schemes such as phase locked loops and dual filter techniques.
